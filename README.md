# Machine Learning based mesh refinement in 3D
Author: Enrico Manuzzi

This is library implements Machine Learning based strategies for mesh
refinement in 3D as described in the following article:
"P. Antonietti, F. Dassi, and E. Manuzzi. Machine learning based refinement
strategies for polyhedral meshes with applications to virtual element and
polyhedral discontinuous galerkin methods. Journal of Computational
Physics, page 111531, 2022."

**Intructions**
1) Before using this library run the main file, in order to set the correct
paths. Do not move this file from its original location.
2) Numerical experiments can be found in the experiments folder.
3) Functions and classes implementations are stored in the utilities folder.
4) Images and data are saved in the oputputs folder.
